## 📊 Coverage Goals

### Current Coverage

- **Files**: 3 test files
- **Tests**: 12 tests (5 passing)
- **Coverage**: ~5% (estimated)

### Target Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 80%+ coverage
- **Component Tests**: 80%+ coverage
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user paths
- **Overall**: 70%+ code coverage

## 🛠️ Testing Best Practices Implemented

1. **Test Organization**
   - Tests co-located with components
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Proper setup/teardown

2. **Mocking Strategy**
   - Chrome APIs fully mocked
   - IndexedDB mocked
   - External dependencies isolated

3. **Testing Patterns**
   - Testing user behavior, not implementation
   - Proper async handling
   - Error state testing

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Complete dashboard component tests
   - Add unit tests for critical utilities
   - Fix remaining test failures

2. **Short Term (Week 1-2)**
   - Achieve 50% component coverage
   - Complete store testing
   - Add API integration tests

3. **Medium Term (Week 3-4)**
   - Reach 70% overall coverage
   - Implement E2E tests
   - Add performance tests

4. **Long Term**
   - Maintain 80%+ coverage
   - Continuous test improvement
   - Add visual regression tests

## 🚀 Running Tests
