                Kelp only stores information that helps authenticate you, such as your account ID,
                email and a token that grants the Kelp website application access to your data. This
                is the same as when you click &lsquo;sign in with Google&rsquo; or &lsquo;sign in
                with Facebook&rsquo; on other websites, however when you make changes or add
                information, your changes are stored at the source and do not pass through Kelpâ€™s
                website.

                Much like a fixer-upper house, where the true value of the home is unclear, our data
                is un-renovated. We have communication tools separate from collaboration tools
                separate from scheduling tools. Each of these individual tools could benefit from
                information in the other tools.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h6" className={classes.body}>
                Messages both contain information, are signals about relationships and link a person
                and a piece of information together. Events serve as an organizing principal as they
                have a topic, and involve a group of people working to produce some artifact. The
                meeting name and attendees are signals in addition to the artifacts created. A
                collaborative document, piece of code or design have both people and information
                attached.

                The mission of Kelp is to figure out how to link that information together in a way
                that provides value to working professionals.

              <Typography variant="h6" className={classes.body}>
                My name is <MuiLink href="http://www.zamiang.com/">Brennan Moore</MuiLink>.
                I&rsquo;ve been professionally building software on the internet for the past 12
                years. I&rsquo;ve built tools for non-profits, art collectors, bike share companies,
                e-commerce and for individuals in healthcare.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h6" className={classes.body}>
                Across all of those experiences, I&rsquo;ve lost documents, missed emails, created
                events with the wrong set of attendees and I&rsquo;ve had relationships languish.
                While we all are responsible for our actions, we are not well suited to dealing with
                the amount of information and notifications we receive every day across an
                increasingly vast set of sources.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="h6" className={classes.body}>
                I hope to use my experience to build tools that help people take back their time and
                attention to focus on what is most important rather than what appears urgent.
