# Next Steps Recommendation

Get intelligent analysis of your project state and prioritized recommendations for next actions.

## Your Task
Use the next-priorities agent for intelligent project analysis:

**To get comprehensive next step recommendations:**
```
Use the next-priorities agent to analyze my current project state and recommend the highest-impact next actions.
```

## What the Agent Provides
- **Critical Issue Detection**: Identifies blocking problems requiring immediate attention
- **Priority-Based Recommendations**: Ranks actions by impact and urgency
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Considers time, energy, and project phase
- **Specific Next Steps**: Provides actionable commands and clear timelines
- **Strategic Insights**: Balances immediate needs with long-term goals

## When to Use
- Starting a development session
- Feeling stuck or unsure what to prioritize
- After completing a major task
- When context has changed significantly
- Daily/weekly planning sessions

## Philosophy
This agent handles complex **analysis and decision-making** - exactly what agents are designed for. It intelligently processes multiple data sources to provide strategic recommendations that a simple command cannot.
