#!/bin/bash

case "$1" in
  start)
    echo "ðŸš€ Starting repository monitoring..."
    npm run monitor:start
    echo "Monitor running in background. Use '/monitor status' to check."
    ;;
  stop)
    echo "ðŸ›‘ Stopping repository monitoring..."
    npm run monitor:stop

    echo "Usage:"
    echo "  /monitor start   - Start background monitoring"
    echo "  /monitor stop    - Stop monitoring"
    echo "  /monitor status  - Check current status"

## What It Does

- **Monitors workflows**: Alerts on failures
- **Tracks PRs**: Never miss a pull request
- **Background operation**: Runs without interrupting work
- **Status persistence**: Check status anytime

## Notes

Monitor runs in background and checks repository every 5 minutes.
Status is saved to `.monitor-status.json` for quick access.
