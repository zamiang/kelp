- **Test Coverage**: 22% (8 test files for 37 commands)
- **Command Examples**: 65% have basic examples
- **Frontmatter Completeness**: 89% (33/37 commands have frontmatter)

### Commands Missing Frontmatter
1. `/atomic-commit` - Critical workflow command missing metadata
3. `/issue` - GitHub integration command missing tools specification
4. `/session-history` - Session management missing allowed-tools

## Conflict Analysis

### Duplicate Functionality

#### 1. Reflection Ecosystem (4 Commands)
- **`/reflect`**: Session and strategic pause reflection (358 lines)
- **`/planning/reflect`**: Session reflection and insights capture (358 lines)
- **`/retrospective`**: Session capture with metadata
- **`/learn`**: Insight capture and learning documentation
- **Assessment**: Severe overlap with confusing boundaries
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate into single `/reflect` with subcommands

#### 2. Recovery Commands (4 Commands)
- **`/recovery-assess`**: Assess recovery situation
- **`/recovery-plan`**: Create recovery plan
- **`/recovery-execute`**: Execute recovery actions
- **`/find-working-equivalent`**: Find working code examples
- **Assessment**: Overly granular workflow that could be unified
- **Recommendation**: Merge into single `/recovery` command with guided workflow

#### 3. Detailed Command Variants (5 Commands)
- **`/todo-detailed`** vs `/todo`
- **`/commit-detailed`** vs `/commit`
- **`/docs-detailed`** vs `/docs` (520 lines vs standard)
- **`/push-detailed`** vs `/push`
- **`/hygiene-detailed`** vs `/hygiene`
- **Assessment**: Unclear when to use detailed vs regular versions
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate using flags or interactive prompts

#### 4. Planning Commands (3 Commands)

- **Project CLAUDE.md**: Uses emojis and enthusiastic language throughout
- **Commands**: Extensive use of emojis and excited tone
- **Resolution**: Standardize on professional, measured tone per global guidelines

#### 2. Commit Standards
- **Global CLAUDE.md**: "Prefer commits < 500 lines, < 200 lines ideal"
- **Project Commands**: Some commands exceed 500 lines themselves
- **Resolution**: Apply same standards to command file sizes

#### 3. TDD Emphasis
- **Project CLAUDE.md**: "MANDATORY: Use Test-Driven Development"
- **Actual Implementation**: Only 22% test coverage
- **Resolution**: Either implement comprehensive TDD or adjust messaging

### Naming Inconsistencies
- Inconsistent use of hyphens vs underscores
- Mixed file organization (flat vs subdirectories)
- No clear category naming convention
- Recovery commands have verbose naming while others are terse

## Utility Assessment

### Overly Complex Commands
| Command | Lines | Complexity | Issues | Recommendation |
|---------|-------|------------|--------|----------------|
| `/docs-detailed` | 520 | Extreme | Self-updating, complex bash logic | Split into modules or simplify |
| `/maintainability-detailed` | 458 | High | Extensive analysis scripts | Consider making it an agent |
| `/issue` | 442 | High | GitHub integration complexity | Break into smaller commands |
| `/version-tag` | 437 | High | Version management automation | Simplify or use existing tools |
| `/design` | 420 | High | Feature planning with templates | Streamline template generation |
| `/planning/reflect` | 358 | High | Duplicate of main reflect command | Merge with primary reflect |

### Redundancy Analysis
| Feature | Instances | Usage Pattern | Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Recovery | 4 commands | Sequential workflow | Merge into guided workflow |
| Hygiene | 2 variants | Regular vs detailed | Single command with --detailed flag |
| Detailed | 5 commands | Unclear differentiation | Consolidate using interactive prompts |
| Reflection | 4 approaches | Overlapping purposes | Single reflection system |
| Planning | 3 commands | Similar idea capture | Unified planning workflow |

### Consolidation Opportunities

#### 1. Merge Reflection Commands
```
BEFORE: /reflect, /planning/reflect, /retrospective, /learn
AFTER: /reflect with subcommands:
  - /reflect quick (current session insights)
  - /reflect session (comprehensive session review)
  - /reflect learn "insight" (capture specific learning)
  - /reflect retrospective (session metadata capture)
```

#### 2. Consolidate Recovery Commands
```
BEFORE: /recovery-assess, /recovery-plan, /recovery-execute, /find-working-equivalent
AFTER: /recovery (guided workflow):
  - Automatically assesses situation
  - Presents recovery options
  - Executes chosen recovery strategy
```

#### 3. Unify Detailed Variants
```
BEFORE: /command-detailed vs /command
AFTER: /command with --detailed flag or interactive prompts
  - Starts with quick mode
  - Offers detailed analysis if needed
  - Reduces command proliferation
```

#### 4. Streamline Planning Commands
```
BEFORE: /idea, /ideation, /design
AFTER: /plan with workflow:
  - /plan idea "quick thought" (capture)
  - /plan session (guided ideation)
  - /plan design "feature" (structured design)
```

### Deprecation Candidates

#### Consider Removing
1. **Complex recovery commands** - Overly engineered for rare scenarios
2. **Detailed command variants** - Unclear value over regular commands
3. **`/issue` command** - GitHub CLI is more capable
4. **`/version-tag`** - Standard npm/git versioning is simpler
5. **Duplicate reflection tools** - After consolidation

### Enhancement Suggestions

#### For Retained Commands
1. **Simplify complex commands** - Break down 300+ line commands
2. **Add comprehensive tests** - Reach stated 60% coverage target
3. **Improve error handling** - Standardize error messages and recovery
4. **Standardize patterns** - Consistent bash script structure
5. **Add practical examples** - Every command should have working examples
