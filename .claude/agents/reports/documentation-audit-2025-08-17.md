## Quality Issues for Improvement

### Format Observations

1. **Command Implementation Patterns**
   - **Finding**: Three different approaches (script-delegation, direct-implementation, hybrid)
   - **Assessment**: This variety is intentional and appropriate for a learning repository
   - **Benefit**: Demonstrates different implementation strategies for educational purposes

2. **Heading Hierarchy**
   - **Pattern**: Minor inconsistencies in H1 vs H2 usage
   - **Files**: A few documentation files
   - **Note**: Generally consistent, minor variations acceptable

3. **Code Block Language Specifiers**
   - **Issue**: Some blocks missing language specification
   - **Files**: Several command files
   - **Recommendation**: Specify language when beneficial for syntax highlighting

### Content Gaps

1. **Error Handling Documentation**
   - **Commands**: `/todo`, `/design`, `/next`
   - **Issue**: Limited information on error scenarios
   - **Impact**: Users may be uncertain how to troubleshoot

2. **Usage Examples**
   - **Commands**: `/learn`, `/reflect`
   - **Issue**: Basic examples only
   - **Note**: May be sufficient for current needs

3. **Prerequisites Documentation**
   - **Commands**: `/release`, `/ci`
   - **Issue**: Dependencies not explicitly stated
   - **Impact**: Commands may fail if prerequisites not met
