## Recommended Next Actions

### üéØ Now (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Review and Test GitHub Issues Integration**
   - **Why**: Just completed major migration from ACTIVE_WORK.md
   - **How**: Test `/todo` command with various operations
   - **Command**: `/todo list`, `/todo add "Test task"`, `/todo done 3`
   - **Expected Time**: 10-15 minutes

2. **Create Issue for Command Implementation**
   - **Why**: Issue #3 mentions unimplemented commands
   - **How**: Break down into specific command issues
   - **Command**: `gh issue create --title "Implement [command] after setup"`
   - **Expected Time**: 5-10 minutes

### üìÖ Today (Next 2-4 hours)
1. **Investigate Issue #3: Unimplemented Commands**
   - **Context**: User reported commands don't work after setup
   - **Prerequisites**: Understand which commands are affected
   - **Success Criteria**: Identify root cause and create implementation plan

2. **Document GitHub Issues Workflow**
   - **Context**: Just migrated from file-based task management
   - **Prerequisites**: Migration is complete
   - **Success Criteria**: Clear user guide for new workflow

### üìà This Week (Strategic Focus)
1. **Command Completeness Initiative**
   - **Strategic Value**: Ensures all advertised commands work correctly
   - **Approach**: Audit all commands, test after setup, fix gaps
   - **Resources Needed**: Test environment, user feedback

2. **User Experience Polish**
   - **Strategic Value**: Smooth onboarding for new users
   - **Approach**: Test npx flow, improve error messages, enhance docs
   - **Resources Needed**: Fresh environment for testing

- **Day Pattern**: Weekend - good for deep work without interruptions

### Development Phase
- **Phase**: Maintenance/Polish
- **Phase-Appropriate Tasks**: Bug fixes, documentation, user experience improvements
- **Phase Transition**: Consider moving to feature development after addressing issue #3

## Command Recommendations
Based on current state, these commands will be most helpful:

1. **`/hygiene`** - Verify everything stays green during work
2. **`npm run todo:list`** - Check GitHub issues integration
3. **`gh issue create --title "Implement missing commands"`** - Break down issue #3
4. **Use session-insights agent** - Analyze recent development patterns

## Issue Management Recommendations
- **Issues to Create**: 
  - Break down issue #3 into specific command implementation tasks
  - Document GitHub Issues workflow guide
- **Issues to Close**: None currently
- **Issues to Label**: Add priority labels to issue #3
- **Issues to Update**: Add more details to issue #3 about which commands fail

## Productivity Insights
- **Momentum Builders**: GitHub Issues migration just completed successfully
- **Focus Sustainers**: All tests green, CI passing - safe to make changes
- **Blocker Removers**: No blockers identified
- **Energy Optimizers**: Sunday morning - ideal for focused development

## Next Review
- **When**: After addressing issue #3 (approximately 2-3 hours)
- **Triggers**: 
  - If any tests start failing
  - When new issues are created
  - After implementing missing commands
- **Tracking**: Monitor issue completion rate and test status
