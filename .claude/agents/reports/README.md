## Report Types

### Audits
Automated quality assessments of the codebase, including:
- Repository quality audits
- Documentation completeness checks
- Test coverage analysis
- Code health metrics

### Retrospectives
Manual reflections on development experiences:
- Learning experiences

- Performance analyses
- Architecture reviews
- Dependency audits
- Security assessments

### Metrics
Quantitative measurements:

- Token consumption reports
- Performance benchmarks
- Productivity metrics

## Naming Convention

Files should follow this pattern:
- Audits: `[type]-audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Retrospectives: `[topic]-retrospective.md`
- Analyses: `[subject]-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Metrics: `[period]-metrics-YYYY-MM.md`

## Generating Reports

Reports can be generated through:
1. Agent commands in `.claude/agents/`
2. Manual creation for retrospectives
3. Automated CI/CD processes
4. Ad-hoc analysis scripts
