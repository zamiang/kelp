last-updated: 2025-08-17---

# Usage Estimator Agent

## Objective
Analyze project characteristics, complexity, and development context to provide accurate, personalized estimates for Claude usage across different types of development tasks.

## Task Instructions

### Phase 1: Project Context Analysis
1. **Codebase Assessment**
   - Analyze project size and complexity (file count, languages, frameworks)
   - Identify testing patterns and infrastructure maturity
   - Assess documentation completeness and structure
   - Evaluate build and deployment complexity

2. **Development Patterns**
   - Review recent git activity and commit patterns
   - Analyze typical change sizes and frequencies
   - Identify recurring task types from commit messages
   - Assess team size and collaboration patterns

3. **Technology Stack Evaluation**
   - Identify primary languages and frameworks
   - Assess tool complexity (TypeScript, bundlers, testing frameworks)
   - Evaluate integration complexity (APIs, databases, external services)
   - Consider learning curve factors for the stack

### Phase 2: Task Complexity Modeling
1. **Base Complexity Factors**
   - **Simple Tasks**: Single file, straightforward logic, existing patterns
   - **Medium Tasks**: Multiple files, moderate complexity, some research needed
   - **Complex Tasks**: Architecture decisions, new patterns, extensive research

2. **Context Multipliers**
   - **New Technology**: 1.5-2x base estimate (learning overhead)
   - **Legacy Code**: 1.3-1.8x base estimate (understanding overhead)
   - **High Test Coverage**: 1.2-1.4x base estimate (additional test work)
   - **Team Collaboration**: 1.1-1.3x base estimate (coordination overhead)

3. **Project Phase Impact**
   - **Setup Phase**: Higher estimates for infrastructure setup
   - **Active Development**: Standard estimates for feature work
   - **Maintenance Phase**: Lower estimates for familiar codebase

### Phase 3: Historical Pattern Analysis
1. **Session History Review**
   - Analyze session-history files for actual usage patterns
   - Compare estimated vs actual usage from previous sessions
   - Identify user's efficiency patterns and learning curves
   - Detect task types that consistently over/under-run estimates

2. **Calibration Factors**
   - Adjust base estimates based on user's historical accuracy
   - Account for user's familiarity with project and tools
   - Consider user's development experience level
   - Factor in user's typical session length and focus patterns

### Phase 4: Intelligent Estimation
1. **Dynamic Base Estimates**
   - Adjust standard estimates based on project-specific factors
   - Consider current context and immediate goals
   - Account for available time and energy levels
   - Factor in upcoming deadlines or constraints

2. **Confidence Intervals**
   - Provide ranges rather than point estimates
   - Indicate confidence level based on available data
   - Highlight assumptions and risk factors
   - Suggest estimation refinements for better accuracy

## Estimation Categories

### Development Tasks
1. **Bug Fixes**
   - Simple: 5-15 messages (typos, obvious issues)
   - Medium: 15-40 messages (investigation required)
   - Complex: 40-100 messages (deep debugging, multiple systems)

2. **Feature Development**
   - Small: 20-50 messages (single component/function)
   - Medium: 50-120 messages (multiple components)
   - Large: 120-300 messages (complex systems, integrations)

3. **Refactoring**
   - Localized: 10-30 messages (single file/function)
   - Module-level: 40-90 messages (component restructure)
   - Architectural: 100-200 messages (system-wide changes)

### Quality & Documentation
1. **Testing**
   - Test setup: 25-55 messages (framework configuration)
   - Test coverage: 30-90 messages (writing tests for existing code)
   - Test debugging: 20-60 messages (fixing failing tests)

2. **Documentation**
   - API docs: 15-35 messages (technical documentation)
   - README updates: 10-20 messages (user-facing docs)
   - Architecture docs: 60-180 messages (comprehensive documentation)

### Learning & Research
1. **Technology Learning**
   - Quick research: 15-30 messages (specific questions)
   - Framework learning: 40-100 messages (new technology adoption)
   - Architecture research: 80-200 messages (complex system design)

## Recommendations

### Estimation Strategy
1. **Start with conservative estimate** for unfamiliar tasks
2. **Break large tasks into smaller chunks** for better accuracy
3. **Add buffer time** for complex debugging or new technology

### Task Optimization
1. **Batch similar tasks** to reduce context switching overhead
2. **Prepare context upfront** to reduce explanation time
3. **Use specific, focused questions** to maximize efficiency
4. **Leverage existing patterns** when possible
