# Session History

> **Note**: Session saving is optional. This repository saves its own development sessions as examples of the feature in use.

This directory preserves raw Claude Code session transcripts for historical analysis and learning.

## Purpose

Session history is for users who want to:

- Keep a personal record of interesting conversations
- Analyze your own learning patterns
- Reference solutions from previous sessions
- Build your own knowledge base

Session history serves a different purpose than checkpoints:

- **Session History**: Raw conversation preservation for analysis and learning
- **Checkpoints**: Structured save points for resuming work

## Directory Structure

```
session-history/
├── YYYY-MM-DD/                       # Date-based organization
│   ├── session-NNN-HHMM-HHMM.txt    # Raw transcript (start-end times)
│   ├── session-NNN-description.md    # Markdown format if needed
│   └── daily-summary.md             # Optional daily summary
├── index.md                          # Master index of all sessions
└── README.md                         # This file
```

## Naming Convention

- **Directory**: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-01-16`)
- **Session files**: `session-NNN-HHMM-HHMM.txt`
  - `NNN`: Session number for that day (001, 002, etc.)
  - `HHMM-HHMM`: Start and end times (optional)
  - Example: `session-001-0830-1030.txt`

## File Formats

### Raw Text Files (.txt)

- Exact conversation as it occurred
- No formatting or modifications
- Includes all messages, errors, and outputs
- Preserves for maximum fidelity

### Markdown Files (.md)

- Used for special sessions needing formatting
- Summaries and analysis
- Index files

## Usage

### Saving a Session

```bash
# Manual save
npm run session:save

# Save delta since last save
npm run session:delta

# List recent sessions
npm run session:list
```

### Retrieving Sessions

Sessions are organized by date, making it easy to find:

1. Navigate to the date directory
2. Sessions are numbered sequentially
3. Check index.md for descriptions

## Best Practices

1. **Save Regularly**: Every 30-60 minutes during long sessions
2. **Save Before Compaction**: Always preserve before context reset
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: When important, rename with description
4. **Create Summaries**: For significant sessions, add daily-summary.md

## What to Save

### Always Save

- Before context compaction
- After major accomplishments
- When discovering important patterns
- Before ending a session

### Consider Saving

- After complex problem solving
- When learning something new
- After successful implementations
- When encountering interesting errors

## Recovery

If you need to recover or reference a previous session:

1. Check session-history/YYYY-MM-DD/ for the date
2. Look for session files from that time period
3. Review the raw transcript for exact conversation
4. Check daily-summary.md if available

## Automation

The session history system includes:

- Automatic date-based organization
- Sequential numbering
- Delta tracking to avoid duplicates
- Index generation

## Storage Guidelines

- Raw text files are small and compress well
- Consider archiving sessions older than 30 days
- Keep significant sessions indefinitely
- Remove redundant delta saves after full saves

## Integration

Session history integrates with:

- `/retrospective` command for analysis
- `/session-history` command for management
- Git for version control (optional)

## Privacy Note

Session history may contain sensitive information:

- Code snippets
- File paths
- Project details
- Error messages

Consider this when sharing or backing up session files.
