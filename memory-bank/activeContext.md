# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Updating main libraries in the Kelp project to get `npm run build` working.

**Current Status**: **OUTSTANDING PROGRESS** - Successfully fixed 24+ component files with Grid compatibility issues. Build error has systematically moved through multiple component categories and is now in website components.

## Recent Changes Made

### Phase 1: Core Framework Updates ✅

1. **Fixed Next.js Configuration**:
   - Converted `next.config.js` from CommonJS to ES modules
   - Removed deprecated `next-compose-plugins` dependency
   - Added proper ES module imports and exports
   - Fixed webpack SVG handling

2. **Resolved TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Next.js automatically updated `tsconfig.json` to set `isolatedModules: true`

### Phase 2: Material-UI Grid Component Migration ✅ (Major Progress)

**Problem**: Material-UI Grid component API has changed in newer versions. The `item` and `xs` props are no longer compatible.

**Files Successfully Updated** (24+ files completed):

**Dashboard Components (5/5)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/dashboard/add-tag-dialog.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/dashboard/desktop-dashboard.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/dashboard/search.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/dashboard/top-nav.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/dashboard/top-tags.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components

**Document Components (1/1)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/documents/document-row.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components

**Homepage Components (5/5)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/homepage/footer.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/homepage/header.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/homepage/image-blocks.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/homepage/install-ui-blocks.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/homepage/ui-blocks.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components

**Meeting Components (3/3)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/meeting/expand-meeting.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components (complex file with many Grid components)
- ✅ `components/meeting/featured-meeting.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components (complex file with multiple Grid components)
- ✅ `components/meeting/meeting-row-below.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components

**Navigation Components (1/1)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/nav/search-bar.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components

**Onboarding Components (1/1)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/onboarding/onboarding.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components (complex file with multiple Grid components)

**Person Components (3/3)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/person/expand-person.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components (complex file with responsive grids)
- ✅ `components/person/person-row.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/person/top-people.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components

**Shared Components (2/2)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/shared/loading.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components
- ✅ `components/shared/meeting-list.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components

**Summary Components (1/1)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/summary/summary.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components (complex file with many Grid components)

**User Profile Components (1/1)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/user-profile/settings.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components (complex file with nested Grid components)

**Website Components (1/6)** ✅:

- ✅ `components/website/add-tag-to-meeting-dialog.tsx` - Replaced Grid with Box components + fixed ListItem compatibility issues

**Pattern Used**: Replacing `Grid` imports with `Box` imports and converting:

- `<Grid container>` → `<Box display="flex">`
- `<Grid item xs={n}>` → `<Box flex="0 0 [percentage]%">`
- `<Grid item>` → `<Box>`
- `<Grid container spacing={n}>` → `<Box display="flex" gap={n}>`
- Complex responsive grids → `<Box flex="1 1 50%" sx={{ '@media (max-width: 900px)': { flex: '1 1 100%' } }>`

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Grid Component Updates**:
   - Fix `components/website/add-website-to-tag-dialog.tsx` (current build error)
   - Continue with remaining website component files
   - Estimated ~5 more files to update

2. **Remaining Files to Update**:
   - `components/website/add-website-to-tag-dialog.tsx` (current error)
   - `components/website/large-website.tsx`
   - `components/website/website-highlights.tsx`
   - `components/website/expand-website.tsx`
   - `components/website/draggable-website-highlights.tsx`

3. **Final Testing**:
   - Verify `npm run build` works completely
   - Test development server functionality
   - Run linting and type checking

## Current Build Error

```
./components/website/add-website-to-tag-dialog.tsx:130:12
Type error: No overload matches this call.
Property 'item' does not exist on type...
```

**Root Cause**: The `add-website-to-tag-dialog.tsx` file has Grid component references that need to be replaced with Box components.

## Key Insights & Patterns

1. **ES Module Migration**: The project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json, requiring all config files to use ES module syntax.

2. **Material-UI Version Compatibility**: The project is using mixed MUI versions (v6 and v7), causing API incompatibilities with Grid components.

3. **Systematic Approach Working**: The file-by-file approach is successfully resolving Grid component issues. Each fix moves the build error to the next file.

4. **Build Process**: Next.js 15.4.6 is working correctly once the configuration and component issues are resolved.

5. **Complex Component Handling**: Large files like `expand-meeting.tsx` required careful systematic replacement of many Grid components while maintaining responsive behavior.

## Technical Decisions Made

- **Grid → Box Migration**: Using Box components with flexbox properties instead of trying to upgrade to newer Grid API
- **ES Module Adoption**: Fully embracing ES modules throughout the configuration
- **Incremental Updates**: Fixing one component file at a time to isolate issues - **PROVEN SUCCESSFUL**
- **Type Safety**: Maintaining strict TypeScript checking throughout the process
- **Responsive Design Preservation**: Using MUI's `sx` prop with media queries to maintain responsive behavior when converting from Grid to Box
