# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Fix Chrome extension runtime errors - resolve critical errors preventing extension functionality.

**Current Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** - Both critical runtime errors have been identified, reproduced, and fixed with comprehensive solutions!

## Latest Work: Extension Runtime Error Fixes ✅

### Phase 4: Extension Runtime Error Resolution ✅ (Most Recent Work)

**Problem**: Two critical runtime errors were preventing the Chrome extension from functioning:

1. **Background Script Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'websiteStore')`
2. **Popup Buffer Error**: `ReferenceError: Buffer is not defined`

**Root Causes Identified**:

- Background script: `store` variable was undefined when trying to access `store.websiteStore`
- Popup script: Browser environment lacks Node.js globals like `Buffer` that dependencies expect

**Solution**: Comprehensive error reproduction, testing, and fixes implemented:

#### A. Background Script Fixes (`extension/src/background.ts`)

1. **Added Robust Store Initialization with Retry Logic**:
   - Created `ensureStoreReady()` function with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s delays)
   - Handles database connection failures gracefully
   - Retries up to 3 times before giving up

2. **Added Comprehensive Null Checking**:
   - Updated `storeTrackedVisit()` with null checks before accessing store properties
   - Updated `trackVisit()` to validate store before proceeding
   - Updated `queryAndSendNotification()` with store validation
   - Changed type from `let store: IStore` to `let store: IStore | null = null`

3. **Added Graceful Error Handling**:
   - Functions return early instead of crashing when store unavailable
   - Comprehensive error logging for debugging
   - Race conditions between tab events and store initialization handled

#### B. Popup Buffer Error Fixes (Webpack Configuration)

1. **Updated `extension/webpack.config.js`**:
   - Added `Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer']` to webpack ProvidePlugin
   - Makes Buffer available globally in browser environment

2. **Updated `extension/webpack-safari.config.js`**:
   - Applied same Buffer polyfill configuration
   - Ensures consistency across all build targets

3. **Development Config Inheritance**:
   - `extension/webpack.dev.js` automatically inherits Buffer polyfill

#### C. Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure Created

1. **Error Reproduction Tests**:
   - `test/simple-error-demo.js` - Successfully reproduces both original errors
   - `test/fixes-validation.js` - Validates that fixes address root causes
   - Both tests run successfully and demonstrate error resolution

2. **Complete Test Suite**:
   - `test/integration.test.ts` - Integration tests with Chrome API mocking
   - `test/background.test.ts` - Background script specific tests
   - `test/popup.test.tsx` - Popup component tests focusing on Buffer errors
   - `test/setup.ts` - Test environment configuration with mocks
   - `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest test runner configuration

3. **Testing Dependencies Added**:
   - Added `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jsdom`
   - Updated `package.json` with test scripts: `test`, `test:run`, `test:ui`

#### D. Documentation Created

1. **`SOLUTION_COMPLETE.md`** - Complete solution summary and validation results
2. **`FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md`** - Detailed technical implementation guide
3. **`TESTING_SOLUTION.md`** - Comprehensive testing documentation
4. **`test/README.md`** - Test usage instructions and scenarios

### Validation Results ✅

**Build Success**:

- ✅ `npm run build-extension` completes successfully without errors
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Webpack includes Buffer polyfill in output

**Error Reproduction Confirmed**:

- ✅ `node test/simple-error-demo.js` reproduces original errors exactly
- ✅ `node test/fixes-validation.js` demonstrates fixes work correctly

**Expected Runtime Behavior**:

- ✅ Background script: Store initialization retries on failure, graceful null handling
- ✅ Popup script: Buffer available for authentication flows and crypto operations
- ✅ No more crashes on tab changes or authentication attempts

## Recent Changes Made

### Phase 1: Core Framework Updates ✅

1. **Fixed Next.js Configuration**:
   - Converted `next.config.js` from CommonJS to ES modules
   - Removed deprecated `next-compose-plugins` dependency
   - Added proper ES module imports and exports
   - Fixed webpack SVG handling

2. **Resolved TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Next.js automatically updated `tsconfig.json` to set `isolatedModules: true`

### Phase 2: Material-UI Grid Component Migration ✅

**Problem**: Material-UI Grid component API has changed in newer versions. The `item` and `xs` props are no longer compatible.

**Solution**: Successfully converted all Grid components to Box components across 25+ files.

### Phase 3: Chrome Extension Build Fix ✅ (Latest Work)

**Problem**: After dependency updates, Chrome extension webpack build failed with ES module compatibility errors.

**Root Cause**: Project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json, but webpack config files used CommonJS syntax.

**Solution**: Converted all webpack configuration files to ES module syntax:

1. **Updated `extension/webpack.config.js`**:
   - Converted from `require()` to `import` statements
   - Added ES module `__dirname` polyfill using `fileURLToPath`
   - Fixed `react-dom` alias issue
   - Added `vm-browserify` polyfill for missing Node.js modules

2. **Updated `extension/webpack.dev.js`**:
   - Converted from CommonJS to ES module syntax
   - Fixed webpack-merge import

3. **Updated `extension/webpack-safari.config.js`**:
   - Applied same ES module conversion
   - Added same polyfills and fixes

4. **Installed Missing Dependencies**:
   - Added `vm-browserify` package for Node.js polyfill

### Phase 2: Material-UI Grid Component Migration ✅ (Previous Work)

**Problem**: Material-UI Grid component API has changed in newer versions. The `item` and `xs` props are no longer compatible.

- `<Grid item xs={n}>` → `<Box flex="0 0 [percentage]%">`
- `<Grid item>` → `<Box>`
- `<Grid container spacing={n}>` → `<Box display="flex" gap={n}>`
- Complex responsive grids → `<Box flex="1 1 50%" sx={{ '@media (max-width: 900px)': { flex: '1 1 100%' } }>`

## Project Completion

✅ **ALL OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED**:

1. **Library Updates Complete**: Next.js 15.4.6, Material-UI v7, TypeScript 5.9 all working
2. **Build Process Fixed**: `npm run build` completes successfully
3. **Development Environment Working**: `npm run dev` starts without issues
4. **Component Migration Complete**: All Grid → Box conversions successful

**Final File Fixed**: `pages/terms.tsx` - converted Grid components to Box components

**No Further Action Required**: The project is now fully updated and functional.

## Final Build Status

✅ **NEXT.JS BUILD SUCCESSFUL**: `npm run build` completes without errors
✅ **CHROME EXTENSION BUILD SUCCESSFUL**: `npm run build-extension` completes without errors
✅ **SAFARI EXTENSION BUILD SUCCESSFUL**: `npm run build-extension:safari` completes without errors
✅ **DEV SERVER WORKING**: `npm run dev` starts successfully on localhost:3000
✅ **ALL COMPONENTS MIGRATED**: Successfully converted all Grid components to Box components

**Final Fix**: Converted all webpack configuration files from CommonJS to ES module syntax to be compatible with `"type": "module"` in package.json.

## Key Insights & Patterns

1. **ES Module Migration**: The project uses `"type": "module"` in package.json, requiring all config files to use ES module syntax.

2. **Material-UI Version Compatibility**: The project is using mixed MUI versions (v6 and v7), causing API incompatibilities with Grid components.

3. **Systematic Approach Working**: The file-by-file approach is successfully resolving Grid component issues. Each fix moves the build error to the next file.

4. **Build Process**: Next.js 15.4.6 is working correctly once the configuration and component issues are resolved.

5. **Complex Component Handling**: Large files like `expand-meeting.tsx` required careful systematic replacement of many Grid components while maintaining responsive behavior.

## Technical Decisions Made

- **Grid → Box Migration**: Using Box components with flexbox properties instead of trying to upgrade to newer Grid API
- **ES Module Adoption**: Fully embracing ES modules throughout the configuration
- **Incremental Updates**: Fixing one component file at a time to isolate issues - **PROVEN SUCCESSFUL**
- **Type Safety**: Maintaining strict TypeScript checking throughout the process
- **Responsive Design Preservation**: Using MUI's `sx` prop with media queries to maintain responsive behavior when converting from Grid to Box
