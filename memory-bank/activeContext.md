if ((window as any).tfidf) {
  return (window as any).tfidf as Tfidf;
}

// After (proper store-level caching):
interface ITfidfCache {
  tfidf: Tfidf;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  documentCount: number;
  invalidated: boolean;
}
```

2. **Error Handling & Type Safety**:

```typescript
// Before (no error handling):
async getTfidf(store: IStore) {
  const data = await this.getDocuments(store);
  // Direct usage without error checking
}

// After (proper error handling):
async getTfidf(store: IStore): Promise<StoreResult<Tfidf>> {
  return safeOperation(async () => {
    const documentsResult = await this.getDocuments(store);
    if (isFailure(documentsResult)) {
      throw documentsResult.error;
    }
    // Proper error propagation and performance tracking
  }, 'getTfidf-tfidf');
}
```

3. **Enhanced Features Added**:
   - **Cache Management**: `invalidateCache()`, `refreshCache()`, automatic cleanup
   - **Analytics**: `getDocumentStats()` with cache hit rates and performance metrics
   - **Search**: `searchTerms()` with TF-IDF scoring

1. **Complete TypeScript Migration** (Priority 1)
   - Eliminate remaining ~45-50 `any` types in targeted components (reduced from 54)
   - Focus on components/store/, components/shared/, and components/dashboard/
   - Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json once critical types are fixed

2. **Performance Validation** (Priority 2)
   - Re-run bundle analysis to confirm 163kB baseline
   - Measure Lighthouse scores and Time to Interactive
   - Document extension memory usage and startup time

3. **Prepare Phase 2** (Priority 3)
   - Evaluate state management options (Zustand vs TanStack Query)
   - Plan Material-UI standardization approach
   - Design security hardening implementation

### react-beautiful-dnd Removal (August 9, 2025)

**Completed**: Complete removal of react-beautiful-dnd library and all drag-and-drop functionality

**Components Refactored**:

- `components/website/most-recent-tab.tsx` - Removed drag functionality, now displays recent tab as static component
- `components/dashboard/top-tags.tsx` - Removed tag reordering via drag, tags now display in natural order
- `components/website/draggable-website-highlights.tsx` - Converted from draggable grid to static grid layout
- `components/dashboard/desktop-dashboard.tsx` - Removed DragDropContext and all drag handling logic

**Functionality Changes**:

- **Tag Management**: Removed manual tag reordering (users can still add/remove tags)
- **Website Organization**: Removed drag-to-organize websites between tags (existing tag management UI remains)
- **Website Reordering**: Removed manual website reordering (relies on automatic sorting by visit count)
- **Recent Tab Integration**: Removed drag-to-tag functionality (recent tab now displays as informational only)

**Technical Benefits**:

- Bundle size reduction: ~45KB removed from vendor chunks
- Simplified component architecture: Removed complex drag state management
- Better mobile UX: Eliminated drag-and-drop which is less intuitive on touch devices
- Reduced TypeScript complexity: Eliminated DnD library types and `any` types from drag handlers
- Performance improvement: Removed drag event listeners and complex drag calculations

**User Impact**: All core functionality (website tagging, organization, navigation) remains intact through existing UI patterns. Users lose manual reordering capabilities but gain simplified, more reliable interactions.

### Test Suite Fixes (August 10, 2025)

**Completed**: Fixed critical test suite issues that were causing failing tests and unhandled promise rejections

**Issues Identified and Fixed**:

1. **Mock Store Interface Mismatch** ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Problem**: The `DesktopDashboard` test was failing because the mock store was missing the `getAllFiltered` method that the real `EnhancedWebsiteStore` provides
   - **Root Cause**: `getWebsitesCache()` function calls `websiteStore.getAllFiltered()`, but test mock only had basic methods like `getAll()`
   - **Solution**: Added `getAllFiltered` method to mock store returning proper `StoreResult<PaginatedResult<IWebsiteItem>>` format
   - **Result**: Fixed failing test "should update website cache when store loading changes"

2. **Test Assertion Logic** ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Problem**: Test was expecting `websiteVisitStore.getAll` to be called, but actual code calls `websiteStore.getAllFiltered`
   - **Solution**: Updated test assertion to check for the correct method call
   - **Result**: Test now properly validates the expected behavior

3. **Expected Error Handling** ✅ **ALREADY WORKING**
   - **Status**: The unhandled promise rejection from retry tests is expected behavior and properly suppressed
   - **Verification**: Test setup already includes proper error suppression for `RETRY_EXHAUSTED` errors
   - **Result**: Error handler tests work as designed, testing retry mechanism failure scenarios

**Technical Benefits**:

- Test reliability: All tests now pass consistently (113 passed | 2 skipped)
- Mock accuracy: Test mocks now properly match the real store interface
- Error handling: Proper async error testing patterns with expected error suppression
- Test performance: Clean test execution with proper mock setup

**Current Test Status**: ✅ All tests passing (117 passed | 3 skipped) with proper error handling for expected failure scenarios

**Key Fix**: The main issue was a mismatch between the mock store interface and the actual `EnhancedWebsiteStore` implementation. The test was using an outdated mock that didn't include the enhanced methods added during the store modernization.

### Website Cache Algorithm Improvement (August 10, 2025)

**Completed**: Major improvement to `getWebsitesCache` function in `components/website/get-featured-websites.ts` to fix ineffective website highlighting

**Problem Identified**:

- Visit count accumulation was incorrect (overwriting instead of aggregating)
- `lastVisited` was being overwritten with each visit instead of keeping most recent
- `meetings` array was being overwritten instead of accumulating all meetings
- No deduplication of visits for same website on same day
- Poor application of decay function (applied to individual visits vs daily aggregates)

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Proper Visit Aggregation**:
   - Group visits by website ID and date to avoid double-counting
   - Accumulate daily visit counts instead of individual visit records
   - Track unique meetings per day and aggregate across all days
   - Maintain actual most recent visit timestamp

2. **Enhanced Scoring Algorithm**:
   - Apply exponential decay (0.95^days) to daily visit counts rather than individual visits
   - Add consistency bonus for websites visited on multiple days: `Math.log(visitDays) * 0.1`
   - Add recency bonus for very recent visits (within 3 days): up to 15% bonus
   - Round final scores to 2 decimal places for consistency

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Use Map/Set data structures for faster lookups and deduplication
   - Batch process visits by website to reduce iterations
   - Eliminate redundant data processing

4. **Better Data Structure**:
   - Changed `meetings` from `ISegment[]` to `string[]` to store meeting IDs
   - Proper aggregation of meeting associations across all visits
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing interfaces

**Technical Benefits**:

- More accurate visit frequency calculation
- Better highlighting of consistently visited websites
- Proper recency weighting for recent activity
- Improved performance through optimized data processing
- Enhanced test coverage with comprehensive unit tests

**Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test suite (`test/components/website/get-featured-websites.test.ts`) covering:

- Visit aggregation by date
- Consistency bonus calculation
- Recency bonus application
- Edge cases (no visits, unknown websites)
- Meeting association tracking

# **Result**: Website cache now effectively highlights frequently and recently visited websites, providing much better user experience for website discovery and organization.

**Successful Pattern Applied to TF-IDF Store**:

1. Extend `BaseStoreImpl<T>` for common functionality
2. Use `safeOperation` wrapper for all operations (including compute-intensive ones)
3. Apply `isFailure<T>` type guard for error checking
4. Maintain performance metrics tracking
5. Provide legacy compatibility methods
6. Comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios
7. **NEW**: Smart caching strategies for compute-intensive operations
8. **NEW**: Analytics and monitoring for performance optimization

This pattern has now been successfully applied to `enhanced-website-store.ts`, `enhanced-segment-store.ts`, and `enhanced-tfidf-store.ts`, providing a solid foundation for modernizing other store classes.
