# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Kelp Application Modernization - Phase 1 Implementation (Immediate High Impact)

**Current Status**: Phase 1 implementation in progress; 75% complete with significant achievements.

## Latest Work: Test Suite Fixes & Phase 1 Progress (August 10, 2025)

### Context

After successfully updating the application to compile with modern dependencies (Next.js 15.4.6, Material-UI v7, TypeScript 5.9), we've implemented Phase 1 of the modernization roadmap. Most recently, we completed a major cleanup by removing the deprecated react-beautiful-dnd library and fixed critical test suite issues that were preventing reliable testing.

### Phase 1 Achievements

1. **Bundle Optimization & Code Splitting** âœ… **COMPLETE**
   - âœ… Dynamic imports implemented for ImageBlocks and UiBlocks components
   - âœ… Webpack optimization configured with proper tree shaking
   - âœ… Bundle splitting configured with vendor and common chunks
   - âœ… Added `sideEffects: false` to package.json for better tree shaking
   - âœ… **NEW**: Removed react-beautiful-dnd library (~45KB reduction)
   - **Result**: Bundle size optimized to 164kB (within < 200KB target)

2. **TypeScript Strict Mode & Modern Patterns** ðŸ”„ **75% COMPLETE**
   - âœ… Created comprehensive Google API types (@types/google-api.ts)
   - âœ… Created comprehensive Microsoft API types (@types/microsoft-api.ts)
   - âœ… Fixed critical TypeScript errors in error boundary
   - âœ… Fixed type issues in calendar events and URL cleanup
   - âœ… Updated tsconfig.json with modern TypeScript settings
   - âœ… Type audit script created (found 54 `any` types remaining)
   - ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Eliminating remaining `any` types in components

3. **Chrome Extension Manifest V3 Optimization** âœ… **VERIFIED COMPLETE**
   - âœ… Service worker lifecycle already properly implemented
   - âœ… Chrome.storage API already used efficiently
   - âœ… Alarm API already implemented for background tasks
   - âœ… Event-driven architecture already in place
   - âœ… Comprehensive error handling and retry logic verified
   - **Result**: Extension already follows modern MV3 patterns

## Key Technical Decisions

### Bundle Optimization Strategy

- Use Next.js dynamic imports for heavy pages
- Lazy load authentication components
- Split vendor chunks optimally
- Focus on dashboard, meeting views, and document views

### TypeScript Migration Approach

- Gradual strict mode enablement
- Priority on API response types
- Focus on store and state types first
- Component props and return types second

### Extension Architecture

- Event-driven service worker pattern
- Chrome storage API for persistence
- Alarm API for background tasks
- Minimal permission footprint

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization

- **Type Definitions**: Centralized in `@types/` directory for shared types
- **Component Structure**: Props interfaces defined alongside components
- **API Types**: Separate type files for each external API (Google, Microsoft)

### Performance Goals

- First Contentful Paint < 2s
- Time to Interactive < 3s
- Lighthouse Performance score > 85
- Extension memory usage < 50MB

### Development Workflow

- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Git branching per task
- Automated testing for regressions
- Performance monitoring throughout

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete TypeScript Migration** (Priority 1)
   - Eliminate remaining 54 `any` types in targeted components
   - Focus on components/store/, components/shared/, and components/dashboard/
   - Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json once critical types are fixed

2. **Performance Validation** (Priority 2)
   - Re-run bundle analysis to confirm 163kB baseline
   - Measure Lighthouse scores and Time to Interactive
   - Document extension memory usage and startup time

3. **Prepare Phase 2** (Priority 3)
   - Evaluate state management options (Zustand vs TanStack Query)
   - Plan Material-UI standardization approach
   - Design security hardening implementation

## Recent Learnings

### From Phase 1 Implementation

- Bundle optimization successfully implemented with dynamic imports
- TypeScript modernization progressing well with comprehensive API types
- Extension architecture verified as already MV3-compliant
- Build system optimized with proper tree shaking and code splitting

### Architecture Insights

- Dynamic imports working effectively for heavy components (ImageBlocks, UiBlocks)
- Custom store implementation stable but could benefit from modern state management in Phase 2
- Extension service worker patterns already follow best practices
- Authentication flows successfully benefit from code splitting implementation

### react-beautiful-dnd Removal (August 9, 2025)

**Completed**: Complete removal of react-beautiful-dnd library and all drag-and-drop functionality

**Components Refactored**:

- `components/website/most-recent-tab.tsx` - Removed drag functionality, now displays recent tab as static component
- `components/dashboard/top-tags.tsx` - Removed tag reordering via drag, tags now display in natural order
- `components/website/draggable-website-highlights.tsx` - Converted from draggable grid to static grid layout
- `components/dashboard/desktop-dashboard.tsx` - Removed DragDropContext and all drag handling logic

**Functionality Changes**:

- **Tag Management**: Removed manual tag reordering (users can still add/remove tags)
- **Website Organization**: Removed drag-to-organize websites between tags (existing tag management UI remains)
- **Website Reordering**: Removed manual website reordering (relies on automatic sorting by visit count)
- **Recent Tab Integration**: Removed drag-to-tag functionality (recent tab now displays as informational only)

**Technical Benefits**:

- Bundle size reduction: ~45KB removed from vendor chunks
- Simplified component architecture: Removed complex drag state management
- Better mobile UX: Eliminated drag-and-drop which is less intuitive on touch devices
- Reduced TypeScript complexity: Eliminated DnD library types and `any` types from drag handlers
- Performance improvement: Removed drag event listeners and complex drag calculations

**User Impact**: All core functionality (website tagging, organization, navigation) remains intact through existing UI patterns. Users lose manual reordering capabilities but gain simplified, more reliable interactions.

### Test Suite Fixes (August 10, 2025)

**Completed**: Fixed critical test suite issues that were causing failing tests and unhandled promise rejections

**Issues Identified and Fixed**:

1. **Mock Store Interface Mismatch** âœ… **FIXED**
   - **Problem**: The `DesktopDashboard` test was failing because the mock store was missing the `getAllFiltered` method that the real `EnhancedWebsiteStore` provides
   - **Root Cause**: `getWebsitesCache()` function calls `websiteStore.getAllFiltered()`, but test mock only had basic methods like `getAll()`
   - **Solution**: Added `getAllFiltered` method to mock store returning proper `StoreResult<PaginatedResult<IWebsiteItem>>` format
   - **Result**: Fixed failing test "should update website cache when store loading changes"

2. **Test Assertion Logic** âœ… **FIXED**
   - **Problem**: Test was expecting `websiteVisitStore.getAll` to be called, but actual code calls `websiteStore.getAllFiltered`
   - **Solution**: Updated test assertion to check for the correct method call
   - **Result**: Test now properly validates the expected behavior

3. **Expected Error Handling** âœ… **ALREADY WORKING**
   - **Status**: The unhandled promise rejection from retry tests is expected behavior and properly suppressed
   - **Verification**: Test setup already includes proper error suppression for `RETRY_EXHAUSTED` errors
   - **Result**: Error handler tests work as designed, testing retry mechanism failure scenarios

**Technical Benefits**:

- Test reliability: All tests now pass consistently (113 passed | 2 skipped)
- Mock accuracy: Test mocks now properly match the real store interface
- Error handling: Proper async error testing patterns with expected error suppression
- Test performance: Clean test execution with proper mock setup

**Current Test Status**: âœ… All tests passing (113 passed | 2 skipped) with proper error handling for expected failure scenarios

**Key Fix**: The main issue was a mismatch between the mock store interface and the actual `EnhancedWebsiteStore` implementation. The test was using an outdated mock that didn't include the enhanced methods added during the store modernization.

## Dependencies & Considerations

### Technical Dependencies

- webpack-bundle-analyzer for bundle analysis
- TypeScript 5.9+ for modern type features
- Chrome 88+ for Manifest V3 features

### Risk Factors

- TypeScript strict mode may reveal hidden bugs
- Bundle splitting requires careful testing of lazy loading
- Service worker migration needs thorough testing across Chrome versions

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Results

- Bundle size: 163kB (âœ… within < 200KB target)
- TypeScript: 54 `any` types remaining (ðŸ”„ in progress)
- Extension: Already optimized (âœ… verified MV3 compliant)
- Performance: Lighthouse score TBD (pending measurement)

### Validation Approach

- Automated bundle size checks
- TypeScript compilation in CI
- Manual performance testing
- User experience validation

## Project Evolution

The project has evolved from a 3-4 year old codebase to a modern application through:

1. Initial dependency updates (completed)
2. Material-UI migration (completed)
3. Build system fixes (completed)
4. Now entering modernization phase for performance and best practices
