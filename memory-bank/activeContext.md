# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Task**: Kelp Application Modernization - Phase 1 Implementation (Immediate High Impact)

**Current Status**: Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation with detailed plan created.

## Latest Work: Phase 1 Planning Complete (January 8, 2025)

### Context

After successfully updating the application to compile with modern dependencies (Next.js 15.4.6, Material-UI v7, TypeScript 5.9), we've created a comprehensive modernization roadmap with 13 improvement areas across 4 phases. Phase 1 focuses on immediate high-impact improvements with relatively low risk.

### Phase 1 Focus Areas

1. **Bundle Optimization & Code Splitting** (3-5 days)
   - Implement dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
   - Configure webpack for optimal tree shaking
   - Analyze and reduce bundle sizes
   - Target: 30-50% reduction in initial bundle size

2. **TypeScript Strict Mode & Modern Patterns** (3-5 days)
   - Enable TypeScript strict mode
   - Replace all `any` types with proper definitions
   - Add comprehensive type definitions for APIs
   - Target: Zero TypeScript errors, 100% type coverage

3. **Chrome Extension Manifest V3 Optimization** (1-2 weeks)
   - Optimize service worker lifecycle management
   - Implement chrome.storage API efficiently
   - Use alarm API for background tasks
   - Target: Memory usage < 50MB, startup < 500ms

## Key Technical Decisions

### Bundle Optimization Strategy

- Use Next.js dynamic imports for heavy pages
- Lazy load authentication components
- Split vendor chunks optimally
- Focus on dashboard, meeting views, and document views

### TypeScript Migration Approach

- Gradual strict mode enablement
- Priority on API response types
- Focus on store and state types first
- Component props and return types second

### Extension Architecture

- Event-driven service worker pattern
- Chrome storage API for persistence
- Alarm API for background tasks
- Minimal permission footprint

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization

- **Type Definitions**: Centralized in `@types/` directory for shared types
- **Component Structure**: Props interfaces defined alongside components
- **API Types**: Separate type files for each external API (Google, Microsoft)

### Performance Goals

- First Contentful Paint < 2s
- Time to Interactive < 3s
- Lighthouse Performance score > 85
- Extension memory usage < 50MB

### Development Workflow

- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Git branching per task
- Automated testing for regressions
- Performance monitoring throughout

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Bundle Analysis** (Day 1)
   - Run `npm run analyze` to establish baseline
   - Document current bundle sizes
   - Identify optimization targets

2. **TypeScript Audit** (Day 1)
   - Count current `any` types
   - List components needing type definitions
   - Plan migration order

3. **Extension Review** (Day 1)
   - Analyze current service worker implementation
   - Review permission usage
   - Plan event-driven migration

## Recent Learnings

### From Previous Updates

- The project uses ES modules throughout (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- Material-UI Grid components successfully migrated to Box components
- Chrome extension build uses webpack with polyfills for Node.js modules
- Testing infrastructure already set up with Vitest

### Architecture Insights

- Custom store implementation could benefit from modern state management
- Heavy use of IndexedDB in extension could be optimized
- Authentication flows are complex and could benefit from code splitting

## Dependencies & Considerations

### Technical Dependencies

- webpack-bundle-analyzer for bundle analysis
- TypeScript 5.9+ for modern type features
- Chrome 88+ for Manifest V3 features

### Risk Factors

- TypeScript strict mode may reveal hidden bugs
- Bundle splitting requires careful testing of lazy loading
- Service worker migration needs thorough testing across Chrome versions

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets

- Bundle size: < 200KB initial
- TypeScript: Zero `any` types, 100% strict mode
- Extension: < 50MB memory, < 500ms startup
- Performance: Lighthouse score > 85

### Validation Approach

- Automated bundle size checks
- TypeScript compilation in CI
- Manual performance testing
- User experience validation

## Project Evolution

The project has evolved from a 3-4 year old codebase to a modern application through:

1. Initial dependency updates (completed)
2. Material-UI migration (completed)
3. Build system fixes (completed)
4. Now entering modernization phase for performance and best practices

This Phase 1 implementation represents the first major step in bringing the application to modern standards while maintaining stability and user experience.
