**Why Kelp Exists**

Kelp is a browser extension designed to help busy people organize websites. This page has both the extension and the marketing website.

Here's a summary of its features and approach:

Automatic Organization: Instead of manual tagging and folders, Kelp uses "smart tags" to automatically group the web pages you visit.

Meeting Association: It can link the websites you view during a meeting to that specific event in your calendar, making them easier to find later.

Privacy-Focused: The application runs locally on your computer. It does not store your personal data, passwords, or Browse history on its servers, and it does not use analytics or tracking tools.

Target Audience: It is specifically designed for people who have a lot of meetings and need an efficient way to manage the links and pages they use.

In essence, Kelp offers a more automated and context-aware way to organize your Web Browser, particularly in a professional setting. It is available as an extension for both Chrome and Firefox.

**User Experience Goals**

- **Seamless Integration**: Kelp should feel like a natural extension of the person's existing tools (their browser), requiring minimal setup and configuration.
- **Minimal Intrusion**: The tool should not disrupt their workflow with unnecessary alerts or prompts.
- **Customizability**: Users should have control over focus intervals, blocked sites, and task management preferences.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Kelp must work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.
