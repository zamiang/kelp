## Implementation Notes

1. **Dependencies**: Some phases can be worked on in parallel, but Phase 1 should be completed first as it provides the foundation.

2. **Testing Strategy**: Each improvement should include tests before considering it complete.

3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as each phase is completed.

4. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to rollback changes if issues arise in production.

5. **Communication**: Regular updates on progress and any blockers encountered.

## Risk Mitigation

- **App Router Migration**: Most complex change, consider incremental migration
- **State Management**: Ensure data migration path from current store
- **Extension Changes**: Test thoroughly across different Chrome versions
- **Breaking Changes**: Maintain backwards compatibility where possible

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 improvements (highest impact, lowest risk)
2. Set up proper branch strategy for development
3. Create detailed technical specifications for each improvement
4. Establish success criteria and testing plans
