- TypeScript Strict Mode & Modern Patterns
- Chrome Extension Manifest V3 Optimization

### Phase 2: Short-term Foundation (Planned - 2-3 weeks)

- Modern State Management
- Material-UI Full Migration
- Extension Security Hardening

### Phase 3: Medium-term Architecture (Planned - 4-6 weeks)

- Next.js App Router Migration

## Key Metrics to Track

### Performance Metrics

- **Current Bundle Size**: TBD (needs analysis)
- **Target Bundle Size**: < 200KB initial
- **Current Lighthouse Score**: TBD
- **Target Lighthouse Score**: > 90

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Current `any` Types**: TBD (needs audit)
- **Target `any` Types**: 0
- **Current TypeScript Coverage**: Partial
- **Target TypeScript Coverage**: 100% strict mode

### Extension Metrics

- **Current Memory Usage**: TBD
- **Target Memory Usage**: < 50MB
- **Current Startup Time**: TBD
- **Target Startup Time**: < 500ms

## Risk Log

### Active Risks

1. **TypeScript Migration**: May uncover hidden bugs requiring fixes
2. **Bundle Splitting**: Could break functionality if not tested thoroughly
3. **Service Worker**: Chrome version compatibility issues

### Mitigation Strategies

- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive testing at each step
- Ability to rollback individual changes
- Monitoring for performance regressions

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Day 1)

1. Run `npm run analyze` for bundle baseline
2. Count and document all `any` types
3. Review current extension architecture
4. Set up performance monitoring

### This Week

1. Complete bundle optimization (Task 1)
2. Complete TypeScript migration (Task 2)
3. Begin extension optimization (Task 3)

### Next Week

1. Complete extension optimization (Task 3)
2. Performance testing and validation
3. Prepare for Phase 2

## Success Indicators

### Phase 1 Complete When:

- [ ] Bundle size reduced by 30-50%
- [ ] Zero TypeScript `any` types
- [ ] Extension memory < 50MB
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance metrics met

### Overall Modernization Complete When:

- All 4 phases implemented
- Performance targets achieved
- Code quality standards met
- User experience improved
- Documentation updated

## Notes

- Phase 1 focuses on highest impact, lowest risk improvements
- Each task can be validated independently
- Rollback plan in place for each change
- User experience is top priority throughout
