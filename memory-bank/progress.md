## Previous Projects (Completed)

### Test Suite Fixes Project âœ…

**Project Goal**: Fix critical test suite issues that were causing failing tests and unhandled promise rejections.

**Completion Date**: August 10, 2025
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Achievements**:

- **Fixed Mock Store Interface Mismatch**: Added missing `getAllFiltered` method to test mocks to match `EnhancedWebsiteStore` interface
- **Fixed Test Assertion Logic**: Updated failing test to check for correct method calls (`websiteStore.getAllFiltered` instead of `websiteVisitStore.getAll`)
- **Verified Error Handling**: Confirmed that unhandled promise rejections from retry tests are expected behavior and properly suppressed
- **Enhanced Test Configuration**: Proper error suppression for expected `RETRY_EXHAUSTED` errors already in place
- **Improved Mock Accuracy**: Test mocks now properly match the real store interface after store modernization

**Root Cause**: The main issue was a mismatch between the mock store interface and the actual `EnhancedWebsiteStore` implementation. The test was using an outdated mock that didn't include the enhanced methods added during the store modernization.

**Results**:

- All tests now pass consistently: 128 passed | 3 skipped (131 total)
- Test reliability improved with accurate mock interfaces
- Test performance enhanced with proper mock setup
- Better test structure matching actual implementation
- Fixed failing test: "should update website cache when store loading changes"
- **NEW**: Enhanced TF-IDF store tests added with 11 comprehensive test cases
