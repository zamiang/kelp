# Project Brief

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Kelp
**Vision**: Help busy professionals organize their web browsing through intelligent, privacy-first automation
**Last Updated**: August 9, 2025

## Problem Statement

Busy professionals with many meetings struggle to organize and retrieve the websites they visit during work. Traditional bookmarking requires manual effort and doesn't provide context about when or why a site was visited. Existing solutions often compromise privacy by storing data in the cloud.

## Solution

Kelp is a browser extension and web application that automatically organizes websites using "smart tags" and associates them with calendar meetings. It runs entirely locally, preserving user privacy while providing intelligent organization.

## Core Features

### Browser Extension (Chrome + Safari)

- **Smart Tags**: Automatic categorization of visited websites
- **Meeting Association**: Links websites to calendar events during meetings
- **Local Processing**: All data stays on the user's device
- **Privacy-First**: No analytics, tracking, or cloud storage

### Web Application

- **Dashboard**: View organized websites and meetings
- **Search**: Find websites by content, tags, or meeting context
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar and Microsoft Graph API support
- **Marketing Site**: Installation guides and feature explanations

## Target Users

**Primary**: Busy professionals who:

- Attend multiple meetings daily
- Research topics across many websites
- Need to find previously visited sites in context
- Value privacy and data control

**Secondary**: Knowledge workers, consultants, researchers, and project managers

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets

- Initial bundle size: < 200KB
- Time to Interactive: < 3s
- Lighthouse Performance score: â‰¥ 90
- Extension memory usage: < 50MB
- Extension startup time: < 500ms

### Code Quality Targets

- TypeScript coverage: 100% (strict mode)
- Zero `any` types
- Test coverage: > 80%
- Zero ESLint errors

### User Experience Targets

- Seamless browser integration
- Minimal setup required
- No workflow disruption
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## In Scope

- Chrome and Safari browser extensions
- Next.js web application with dashboard
- Google Calendar and Microsoft Graph integration
- Local data storage and processing
- Smart tagging and search functionality
- Privacy-focused architecture

## Out of Scope

- Firefox extension (not currently supported)
- Cloud data storage or synchronization
- Analytics or user tracking
- Mobile applications
- Third-party integrations beyond Google/Microsoft

## Technical Constraints

- **Privacy**: All processing must be local
- **Performance**: Must not impact browser performance
- **Compatibility**: Support modern browsers (Chrome 88+, Safari 14+)
- **Security**: Follow browser extension security best practices
- **Maintenance**: Code must be maintainable by small team

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Modernization Foundation (Current)

- Bundle optimization and code splitting
- TypeScript strict mode implementation
- Chrome extension Manifest V3 optimization

### Phase 2: Architecture Improvements

- Modern state management
- Material-UI standardization
- Security hardening

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Next.js App Router migration
- Enhanced testing infrastructure
- Performance monitoring

### Phase 4: Polish & Operations

- Modern CSS architecture
- CI/CD pipeline
- Analytics and monitoring

## Risk Factors

- **Browser API Changes**: Extension APIs may change
- **Calendar API Limits**: Rate limiting from Google/Microsoft
- **Privacy Regulations**: Must comply with data protection laws
- **Performance Impact**: Extension must not slow browsing
- **User Adoption**: Requires behavior change from users

## Success Indicators

### Technical Success

- All performance targets met
- Zero critical bugs in production
- Successful browser store approvals
- Positive user feedback on performance

### Business Success

- User retention > 70% after 30 days
- Positive reviews in browser stores
- Organic growth through word-of-mouth
- Sustainable development velocity

## Dependencies

### External Services

- Google Calendar API
- Microsoft Graph API
- Chrome Web Store
- Safari App Store

### Technical Dependencies

- Next.js framework
- Material-UI component library
- TypeScript compiler
- Webpack build system
